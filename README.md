# Zuber Taxi Demand Analysis

This project analyzes ride request patterns for **Zuber**, a fictional ride-hailing startup, with the goal of identifying opportunities to optimize driver distribution during a local festival in Chicago. Using SQL for database queries and Python for exploratory analysis and visualization, this project identifies how weather and temporal trends affect demand.

---

## 📊 Project Objective

Zuber is considering expanding operations in a small town in Chicago. To make informed business decisions, they need insights into when and where ride demand increases. Your task was to investigate patterns in trip data during a special event month (November 2017) to advise on resource allocation.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** (PostgreSQL) – data extraction and aggregation
- **Python** – data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook** – code and results presentation
